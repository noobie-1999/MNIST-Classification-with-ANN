# MNIST-Classification-with-ANN

## MNIST DATASET

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

##APPROACH

Artificial Neural Networks have been used in the project. A network with 4 hidden layers with 500 neurons in each layer has been made. Initialization is done using Xavier Initializer which increased the accuracy. The accuracy of LogisticRegressor class in the SKLearn package was around 83%. This model has achieved the accuracy of 97% which is better than most of the ANN models out there.
